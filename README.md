# EnKoat Quote Portal & Performance Dashboard

## üìù Summary  
This is a **full‚Äëstack prototype** built for the EnKoat internship assignment. It simulates a contractor‚Äëfacing interface where users can:
- **Submit roofing project quotes** via a responsive form  
- **Browse a performance dashboard** with key metrics and interactive charts  
- **View a contractors list** showing each contractor‚Äôs project stats  

> **Note:** All data you see in the UI is currently loaded from **mock data**. The backend API (Express + MongoDB) is scaffolded but **not yet wired up**‚Äîform submissions and dashboard/contractor views still use in‚Äëmemory data. Backend calls will be implemented in the next iteration.
